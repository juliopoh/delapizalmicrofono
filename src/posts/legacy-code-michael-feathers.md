<div class="episode-about">
Michael Feathers, the author of the super-popular book “working effectively with legacy code”, talks about how systems are like living organisms.
<br/> <br/>We also talk about:
<ul>
<li> legacy code and how to deal with it</li>
<li> how systems almost feel like living organisms</li>
<li> how we are on a journey with our code, and why it’s so important to care for it,</li>
<li> how legacy code is the result of an organization where engineers turn faster (leave the company/team) than the code churns.</li>
</ul>
