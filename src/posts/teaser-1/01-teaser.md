Hello and Welcome to the software engineering unlocked podcast. I’m your host Doctor McKayla and I open you the doors to software companies such as Microsoft, Google or Facebook. But also to smaller startups such as Hashnode, Bitmov or Automatic.

I talk to experienced developers from different companies about how they develop software.

How did they come to where they are today?  
 How is it to be working at their company?  
 Which software engineering processes and best practices do they follow?  
 Do they do code reviews?  
 Do they have automated tests?  
 And how do they assess the productivity of the team or an individual developer?

My guests share with you their personal stories and their believes and values when it comes to software engineering. We talk about the companies tech stack, processes, and tools but also about mindset and culture.

Finally, we dig deep to really understand the recipes for success.

How do those teams and companies manage to build maintainable, scalable and reliable software people love?

Find out together with me in the software engineering unlocked podcast.  
Subscribe today. We launch soon!
