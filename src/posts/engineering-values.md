<div class="episode-about">
Learn how crystal clear engineering values can help you and your team to build a strong engineering culture.
<br/> <br/>We also talk about:
<ul>
<li> We deep dive into why well-defined, explicit engineering values are a competitive advantage for your engineer teams.</li>
<li> help everyone to make decisions that are aligned with your company goals and values;</li>
<li> how they help newcomers understand what your team expects from them;</li>
<li> and how they help potential candidates to evaluate whether they would strive in your engineering team.</li>
<li> But knowing your engineering core values form also the basis for being able to answer the hard questions every engineering team should ask themselves, like:</li>
<li> what does high-quality code mean to us,</li>
<li> how much testing do we need,</li>
<li> or when is a code change ready for release?</li>

</ul>
